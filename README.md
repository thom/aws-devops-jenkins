# Udacity Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Program - Capstone

This project applies the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree program. These include:

* Working in AWS
* Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Building pipelines
* Working with CloudFormation to deploy clusters
* Building Kubernetes clusters
* Building Docker containers in pipelines

It develops a CI/CD pipeline for a micro services application (simple website with nginx) with rolling deployment. It also contains Continuous Integration steps. Continuous Deployment includes:

* Pushing the built Docker container to the Docker Hub repository
* Deploying the Docker container to a small Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS

## Setup Jenkins and Blue Ocean

[Setup a Jenkins build server](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/setup-jenkins-build-server/) and install the [Blue Oceans plugin](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/blueocean/getting-started/).

Open Blue Ocean and create a new pipeline:
